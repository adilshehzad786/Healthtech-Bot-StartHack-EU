##  Project HealthBot

### Main Idea:
Develop an intuitive chatbot to help people understand medical jargon better.

### Services we are using

* Python 
* Microsoft Bot Framework v4 
* Adapters
* Git
* GitHub 
* GitHub Actions 
* GitPod
* HackMD


### Why We Are Using Python ?

Python is the most widely language used for today and as we discussed that our aim is to create a Health bot and Python is good with ChatBots so we prefered to work with Python . 

### Why We Are Using Microsoft Bot framework 

Azure Bot Service provides an integrated environment that is purpose-built for bot development that why we are using Microsoft Bot framework for StartHack EU Hackathon Project.

## About Adapters

Adapters provide an abstraction for your bot to work with a variety of environments.

A bot is directed by it's adapter, which can be thought of as the conductor for your bot. The adapter is responsible for directing incoming and outgoing communication, authentication, and so on. The adapter differs based on it's environment (the adapter internally works differently locally versus on Azure) but in each instance it achieves the same goal.

In most situations we don't work with the adapter directly, such as when creating a bot from a template, but it's good to know it's there and what it does. The bot adapter encapsulates authentication processes and sends activities to and receives activities from the Bot Connector Service. When your bot receives an activity, the adapter wraps up everything about that activity, creates a context object, passes it to your bot's application logic, and sends responses generated by your bot back to the user's channel.

### Why Git , GitHub  & GitPod

**Git** is the most common Version Control System tool and mostly use for colloboration .

**GitHub** is home to the largest software development community on the planet with over 50M+ developers and 100M+ projects. Grey software uses GitHub to manage collaborative open source software development projects and find the organization through the Github Sponsors program.

**Gitpod** is an open source platform for automated and ready-to-code development environments that blends into your existing workflow. It enables developers to describe their dev environment as code and start instant and fresh development environments for each new task directly from your browser.

### Why HackMD?

HackMD Is the opensource tool which we are using for the Project Documentation . 


## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python 3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Python "Virtual Environments" allow Python packages to be installed in an isolated location for a particular application, rather than being installed globally, as such it is common practice to use them. Click [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) to learn more about creating _and activating_ Virtual Environments in Python.

### Clone
Clone a copy of the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adilshehzad786/Healthtech-Bot-StartHack-EU.git
```
### Creating Virtual Environments

```
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

```

## Git & GitHub Basics 

```
git add . 

git commit -m " Your message"

git branch your-name_dev

git checkout your-name_dev

git branch -M your-name_dev

git push -u origin your-name_dev

```
## Bot Working 

```
 cd Health Bot
 
 pip install -r requirements.txt 
 
 python main.py

```

## Current Output 

```
gitpod /workspace/Healthtech-Bot-StartHack-EU/Health Bot $ python main.py
Hi... I'm a Health Bot (Still in Development State) 
What is your Name?
Adil
What is your Gender
Male
```
