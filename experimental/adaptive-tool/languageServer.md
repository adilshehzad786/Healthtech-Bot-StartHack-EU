## Introduction of language server

- Language Servers can be implemented in any language and run in their own process
- They communicate with the code editor through the Language Server Protocol
- Any LSP-compliant language toolings can integrate with multiple LSP-compliant code editors
- Any LSP-compliant code editors can easily pick up multiple LSP-compliant language toolings
- In this way, LSP is a win for both language tooling providers and code editor vendors!
